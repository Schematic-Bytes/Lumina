# Lumina

Lumina is an innovative project that reimagines the way users interact with images and search for visual content. With Lumina, users can seamlessly search for images by providing a text-based query or by selecting an existing image as a reference.

Text-Based Search: Users can enter keywords, phrases into Lumina's search bar. The intelligent algorithm behind Lumina analyzes the text query and retrieves relevant images from a vast database. It's a powerful tool for finding images that match your specific criteria, making it a valuable resource for various industries, including marketing, art, and research.

Image-Based Search: Lumina takes visual search to the next level by allowing users to upload or select an image as a search query. Simply choose an image, and Lumina will use advanced image recognition technology to find visually similar or related pictures. This feature is especially handy when you've found an image you like but need more examples or want to explore similar visual styles.
